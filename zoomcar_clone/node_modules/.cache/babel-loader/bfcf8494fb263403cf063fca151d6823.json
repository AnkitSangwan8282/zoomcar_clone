The Member is under obligation to ensure that the account from\r\n        which the amounts are to be collected have sufficient funds or credit\r\n        available to cover any charges. Member is solely responsible for any\r\n        associated bank or credit card charges or fees. Member may be charged a\r\n        processing fee for a declined credit or debit card payment. In the event\r\n        the Member defaults on any payments, Zoomcar is entitled to charge\r\n        reminder fees and default interest in accordance with the provisions of\r\n        the law. In addition, Zoomcar may utilize third parties to collect\r\n        amounts owed to Zoomcar by a Member. With all fees mentioned above,\r\n        Zoomcar reserves the right to prohibit a Member from making a subsequent\r\n        reservation until all outstanding fees in the Member's account have been\r\n        paid in full. In the event a fee is incurred, Members will receive an\r\n        email invoice from Zoomcar that will have detailed payment instructions\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>Collision or other incident:</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Zoomcar provides full wrap unlimited third party liability insurance\r\n        without a maximum cap. If member is involved in an unintentional/non\r\n        consequential incident/accident (including but not limited to a\r\n        collision or misuse of the vehicle) Member will be responsible for a\r\n        standard insurance deductible payment of up to ₹ 10,000. The Member will\r\n        be obligated to pay the repair cost up to ₹ 10000. The payment owed will\r\n        be deducted from the security deposit, if any. Should the security\r\n        deposit not cover the payment (in the case the Member has accrued late\r\n        return, excess km, etc charges) the balance of the payment owed shall be\r\n        payable by the Member separately as an additional outstanding.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h2>Tolls:</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        By joining Zoomcar, the Member agrees to pay Zoomcar the costs, charges,\r\n        fees and expenses set out in the Agreement, including specifically and\r\n        without limitation those set forth in this schedule. The following is\r\n        not exhaustive and other specific fees, costs and charges may apply.\r\n        Other applicable costs will be communicated to the Member. Capitalized\r\n        terms used in this schedule shall have the same meaning assigned to such\r\n        terms in the Agreement. Zoomcar reserves the right to change the terms\r\n        of this Policy from time to time and shall give notice of such changes\r\n        to the Member in a timely manner. Notice to the Members shall be\r\n        considered given when such notice is indicated and accessible from the\r\n        first page accessed after the Member log-on to the Zoomcar website, or\r\n        by email to the Member's email address provided to Zoomcar in the\r\n        Member's application or most recently provided to Zoomcar. Member agrees\r\n        that the amended terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be\r\n        effective and binding the earlier of (1) the effective date indicated in\r\n        such notice; or (2) on the date posted on Zoomcar's website.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default FleetvechilePolicy"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
