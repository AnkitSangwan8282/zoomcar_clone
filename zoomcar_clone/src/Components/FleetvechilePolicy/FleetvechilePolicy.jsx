        Note: Payments owed by members will be deducted from the security

        <h1 style={{textAlign: "left", color: "green"}}>Member's Responsibility</h1>
        <p style={{color: "black", fontWeight:"500"}}>
          If a Zoomcar member is violating the law or Zoomcar rules, for example
          by overspeeding or driving drunk, the member will be responsible for
          all damage, liability, and fines and could face legal action.
        </p>
        <h2>Responsibility for Payment:</h2>
        <p>
          Payments by Members shall be made with his/her credit card or debit
          card. The Member is under obligation to ensure that the account from
          which the amounts are to be collected have sufficient funds or credit
          available to cover any charges. Member is solely responsible for any
          associated bank or credit card charges or fees. Member may be charged
          a processing fee for a declined credit or debit card payment. In the
          event the Member defaults on any payments, Zoomcar is entitled to
          charge reminder fees and default interest in accordance with the
          provisions of the law. In addition, Zoomcar may utilize third parties
          to collect amounts owed to Zoomcar by a Member. With all fees
          mentioned above, Zoomcar reserves the right to prohibit a Member from
          making a subsequent reservation until all outstanding fees in the
          Member's account have been paid in full. In the event a fee is
          incurred, Members will receive an email invoice from Zoomcar that will
          have detailed payment instructions
        </p>
        <h2>Collision or other incident:</h2>
        <p>
          Zoomcar provides full wrap unlimited third party liability insurance
          without a maximum cap. If member is involved in an unintentional/non
          consequential incident/accident (including but not limited to a
          collision or misuse of the vehicle) Member will be responsible for a
          standard insurance deductible payment of up to ₹ 10,000. The Member
          will be obligated to pay the repair cost up to ₹ 10000. The payment
          owed will be deducted from the security deposit, if any. Should the
          security deposit not cover the payment (in the case the Member has
          accrued late return, excess km, etc charges) the balance of the
          payment owed shall be payable by the Member separately as an
          additional outstanding.
        </p>
        <h2>Tolls:</h2>
        <p>
          By joining Zoomcar, the Member agrees to pay Zoomcar the costs,
          charges, fees and expenses set out in the Agreement, including
          specifically and without limitation those set forth in this schedule.
          The following is not exhaustive and other specific fees, costs and
          charges may apply. Other applicable costs will be communicated to the
          Member. Capitalized terms used in this schedule shall have the same
          meaning assigned to such terms in the Agreement. Zoomcar reserves the
          right to change the terms of this Policy from time to time and shall
          give notice of such changes to the Member in a timely manner. Notice
          to the Members shall be considered given when such notice is indicated
          and accessible from the first page accessed after the Member log-on to
          the Zoomcar website, or by email to the Member's email address
          provided to Zoomcar in the Member's application or most recently
          provided to Zoomcar. Member agrees that the amended terms and
          conditions of this Agreement shall be effective and binding the
          earlier of (1) the effective date indicated in such notice; or (2) on
          the date posted on Zoomcar's website.
